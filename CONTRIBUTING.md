**2.0.0 -> 3.0.0**


For any change that will not break builds, but is not insignificant (*adding options, removing rules, or changing implementations of a rule*), please bump the minor version.

**2.0.0 -> 2.1.0**

For *style* changes, or *small patches that change formatting, etc*, please bump the patch version.
